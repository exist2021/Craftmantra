                Rtn PHF Renu Jayaram is a Social Entrepreneur with over 20 years of business experience, always driven to be a job provider rather than a job seeker. As an art lover, she founded Craft Mantra in 2018 as a concept store and a platform to pursue her dream of empowering women and giving opportunities to hidden local artisans.

                Craft Mantra is built on a philosophy where empathy, humanity, and kindness are prioritized over numbers and profits. It is a place where product innovation is key, and ideas are valued. Renu's "success mantra" is simple: "build relationships and business will follow".
              </p>

Craft Mantra’s offerings include eco-bags, accessories, decor, and apparel.
