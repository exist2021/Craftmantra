              Crafts Mantra was founded by Renu Jayaram in April 2018. She realized that talented, hardworking women creators often lacked a continually available marketplace to sell their products. They waited from fair to fair while products gathered dust. The company was born as a place where the talent of women and local artists could be discovered, honed, and channeled, giving small businesses an opportunity to reach potential customers. This is where Renu found her Ikigaiâ€”a journey, not a destination.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground md:text-lg/relaxed font-body">
                  Renu Jayaram grew up with an entrepreneurial spirit, encouraged by her father to be a provider of jobs rather than a seeker. After contributing to a family business for about twenty years, the idea for Crafts Mantra started brewing after she organized a marketing fair for women entrepreneurs.
